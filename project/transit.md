# Background
Ventra is the current electronic fare payment system for all Chicago public transportation, and their central offering, the Ventra mobile app, has well over 2 million downloads. Yet, it consistently fails to meet customer expectations for a seamless and intuitive commute. As a Chicagoan myself, I set out to explore the question: How might we design a new version of the Ventra app that fulfills the Ventra fare payment systems’ promise of making transit travel faster and more convenient for Chicago public transportation users?

### How might we...
- bridge the gap between physical and digital payment?
- support riders with different transit needs?
- personalize the transit experience for individual users? 
- provide clear assistance to riders in need?


# Research
Before beginning ideation, I sought to analyze the scope of current fare collection systems, determine the needs of users and their motivations for utilizing Chicago public transportation and the Ventra app, and identify the current pain points of users.

### Audience
Based on preliminary research on Chicago transit ridership, I identified my main audience as a diverse collection of both regular and temporary commuters. I broke those people down into a few different categories.

1. **Suburban Commuters**—Regular users who primarily ride the Metra train, these users choose public transportation out of convenience and likely use it only to travel to and from work 
2. **Chicago Natives**—Regular users who live downtown, these users are more likely to use the CTA and Pace buses for all their transportation needs within the city
3. **Tourists and Occasional Riders**—These users are visitng Chicago for a brief time or only use public transportation on occassion, they primarily rely on the 'L' train to see the city or go to leisure events

### Motivations
I also synthesized users primary motivations for using the mobile app from the UX interviews for its intial release in 2015:
- reducing time spent in the station
- convenience of having your “pass” on you all the time (feature not yet incorporated)
- ease of having route/time/transit info in one place
- automatic reloading and low balance notifications 

### Pain Points
I coded hundreds of reviews for the Ventra app from the Google Play App Store for common issues. The full list includes miscellaneous bugs, issues logging in, trouble accessing cards between devices, inaccurate transit info, privacy violations, and overcharging for rides, among many others.

###### Some notable customer reviews of the current app's design.

Based on this exercise, I realized I needed to understand real users, not just online reviewers, point of view more, so I gave empathy interviews to a random selection of riders at my local transit stop, the Davis street transit center, which includes an L, Metra, and CTA/Pace bus stop, to capture a variety of user perspectives.


# Ideation 
First, I used my research to establish three distinct personas which capture the breadth of potential Ventra mobile app users, not only demographically but in purpose, needs, and pain-points.

### Personas
1. **Stan Lewinsky**–is a wealthy middle-aged suburban businessman who voluntarily rides the Metra to work
2. **Monica Ogilvy**–is a young Chicago native and nurse on the South Side who regularly uses CTA and Pace buses 
3. **Lucas and Marcia Oliveira**– are visiting Chicago for two weeks with their young children; they the ‘L’ and CTA buses to visit tourist destinations. 

Based on these personas as well as user motivations from my research, I created infromal user flows for each task one might wish to complete with the app. I used these user flows to determine the information architecture of the app, relying on repeated actions

# Professional interviews
Based on our exercise, we realized we needed to understand the museum's point of view more, so we set up interviews with professionals who worked with or at these organizations. These interviews were to empathize with a new audience, but we were also looking to potentially partner with a museum to execute the project.

At this point in our process, we were considering many avenues for a final product and deciding whether we wanted to partner with a local museum, use a space at Northeastern, or create a pop-up museum that explored our ideas. We decided to pursue a partnership because we thought that although we would need to deal with museum bureaucracy, it would give us the best opportunity to deal with space and a large collection of work. We were originally most interested in the MFA due to its proximity, traditional space, large collection, and it was a good example of the problems we identified.

# Proof of concept

After we knew the MFA wouldn’t be a viable partnership, we decided to pursue a mobile app. By working with this platform instead of working with large screens or installations, we will not need to worry about our work becoming rapidly obsolete, and our solution can easily extend to other museums. Additionally, our work can be easily created and implemented, allowing us to quickly learn from feedback and create improvements. Over about 3 weeks, we established the information architecture, sketched wireframes and started preliminary designs.

# Working with Harvard Art Museums
About halfway through the project, we met with the Harvard Art Museums and decided to move forward with using <a href="https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/api">their open API</a> and designing the experience around their space.

# Implementation
Once we decided on this direction, we designed the prototype iteratively based on in-person testing at the museum itself. Some ideas we explored in this phase included:

**Beacon technology** — We explored placing beacons in the space to power experiences like letting users explore art near them in place


**Color based tours** — Using the Harvard Art Museums' robust API, we could use their data to make unique kinds of tours.


**Creating your own tours** — By simply letting users select from a list of works on view, then ordering those by room, we could easily create custom tours.

**Audio-based experience** — Utilizing the beacon technology, we also began exploring voice and music based experiences that wouldn't require looking at your phone.

# Impact

In the end, we hope the project can be an example to institutions what is possible when a robust, thoughtful API is available. The project won the Humanities & Arts award at [Northeastern’s Research, Innovation, and Science Exposition (RISE)](https://www.northeastern.edu/rise/).
