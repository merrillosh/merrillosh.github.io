# Background
Ventra is the current electronic fare payment system for all Chicago public transportation, and their central offering, the Ventra mobile app, has well over 2 million downloads. Yet, it consistently fails to meet customer expectations for a seamless and intuitive commute. As a Chicagoan myself, I set out to explore the question: How might we design a new version of the Ventra app that fulfills the Ventra fare payment systems’ promise of making transit travel faster and more convenient for Chicago public transportation users?

### How might we...
- bridge the gap between physical and digital payment?
- support riders with different transit needs?
- personalize the transit experience for individual users? 
- provide clear assistance to riders in need?


# Research
Before beginning ideation, I sought to analyze the scope of current fare collection systems, determine the needs of users and their motivations for utilizing Chicago public transportation and the Ventra app, and identify the current pain points of users.

### Audience
Based on preliminary research on Chicago transit ridership, I identified my main audience as a diverse collection of both regular and temporary commuters. I broke those people down into a few different categories.

1. **Suburban Commuters**—Regular users who primarily ride the Metra train, these users choose public transportation out of convenience and likely use it only to travel to and from work 
2. **Chicago Natives**—Regular users who live downtown, these users are more likely to use the CTA and Pace buses for all their transportation needs within the city
3. **Tourists and Occasional Riders**—These users are visitng Chicago for a brief time or only use public transportation on occassion, they primarily rely on the 'L' train to see the city or go to leisure events

### Motivations
I also synthesized users primary motivations for using the mobile app from the UX interviews for its intial release in 2015:
- reducing time spent in the station
- convenience of having your “pass” on you all the time (feature not yet incorporated)
- ease of having route/time/transit info in one place
- automatic reloading and low balance notifications 

### Pain Points
I coded hundreds of reviews for the Ventra app from the Google Play App Store for common issues. The full list includes miscellaneous bugs, issues logging in, trouble accessing cards between devices, inaccurate transit info, privacy violations, and overcharging for rides, among many others.

###### Some notable customer reviews of the current app's design.

Based on this exercise, I realized I needed to understand real users, not just online reviewers, point of view more, so I gave empathy interviews to a random selection of riders at my local transit stop, the Davis street transit center, which includes an L, Metra, and CTA/Pace bus stop, to capture a variety of user perspectives. Many shared the complaints of online reviewers, but were also interested in expanding Ventra's existing features by allowing you to scan your phone to pay your fare and improving the transit tracking portion of the app.


# Ideation 
First, I used my research to establish three distinct personas which capture the breadth of potential Ventra mobile app users, not only demographically but in purpose, needs, and pain-points.

### Personas
1. **Stan Lewinsky**–is a wealthy middle-aged suburban businessman who voluntarily rides the Metra to work
2. **Monica Ogilvy**–is a young Chicago native and nurse on the South Side who regularly uses CTA and Pace buses 
3. **Lucas and Marcia Oliveira**– are visiting Chicago for two weeks with their young children; they the ‘L’ and CTA buses to visit tourist destinations. 

Based on these personas and the user motivations from my research, I created informal user flows for each task one might wish to complete with the app. I used these user flows to determine the information architecture of the app.

# Proof of concept & Usability Testing
Over several weeks, I worked with this information architecture and my user pain points to produce low-fidelty wireframes for some of the most important app screens and linked them into a very basic interactive prototype. 

I conducted informal usability testing by asking individual Chicago Transit riders to complete some of the aforementioned tasks such as creating a Ventra account, checking transit times on a regular route, and adding transit value to an existing Ventra card and recording the time they took to complete the task as well as the number of incorrect clicks they made. Additionally, I asked users which additional features, if any, made their transportation experience more convenient or more confusing. 

I designed and updated my prototype interatively based on this testing, making several changes to the interface and features.

# Implementation
Once I was confident in the functionality of my design, I created an incomplete high-fidelity prototype incorporating both modernized visual design ideas and the current Ventra branding. The wide range of responses I observed during usability testing prompted me to prioritize accessibility over minimalist design by adding labels to all icons and maximizing color contrast within the interface.

### Major features incorporated in the final redesign
- **Transit store**-an entirely new feature that allows users to purchase tickets/passes/transit value in one convenient location 
- **Transit search**-a simplfied transit tracker that encourages users to search for stops and add frequent routes to favorites
- **Dispute charges**-a simple addition to account history that allows users to dispute charges made to ther Ventra card through the app, avoiding long customer service wait times
- **Journey planner**-a new service that enables users to plan a trip to/from a destination on public transit, purchase any necessary passes/tickets for the trip, and add it to their calendar in advance
- **Privacy protection**-all users can now choose to accept or decline location services, declining only alters access to features which require location tracking

# Impact
In the end, I hope this project can inspire future updates to the Ventra mobile app and push the city of Chicago and the Chicago Transit Authority to demand better performance from their mobile payment system on behalf of the city's transit riders. 

In October 2020, about two months after I completed this project, the CTA released an updated version of the app including several of my suggested features such as Metra tickets available from the home screen, ability to plan trips in advance, and a simplified UI for the transit tracker.
